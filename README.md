# KNN-Algorithm-for-Diabetes-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Classifier
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not. The model uses a real-world dataset and applies preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation to deliver accurate classification results.
